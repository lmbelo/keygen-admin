**Keygen Admin** is a frontend UI for interacting with a self-hosted [Keygen.sh](https://keygen.sh/) instance. Keygen is a service for managing license keys in software.

If you're an app developer, and you sell software with a license, Keygen.sh is an easy API to manage that. They provide a self-hosted option, so you can run it on your own servers.

`Keygen Admin` is simple UI over that API.

## Dockefile
